This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, and it returns incorrect or inconsistent values. This might happen due to issues with layout calculations, especially when dealing with dynamically sized components or complex layouts. The values obtained from `Dimensions.get('window')` and `Dimensions.get('screen')` may not match or reflect the actual screen size. This can lead to unexpected UI rendering and positioning problems.

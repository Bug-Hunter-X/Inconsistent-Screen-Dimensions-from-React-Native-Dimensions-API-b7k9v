# React Native Dimensions API Inconsistency Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where the `Dimensions` API in React Native returns inconsistent or incorrect screen dimensions. This can cause problems with UI rendering and positioning, particularly when dealing with dynamic layouts or component sizing.

## Bug Description

The `Dimensions.get('window')` and `Dimensions.get('screen')` methods may return values that don't match the actual screen dimensions or are inconsistent across different renders or device orientations. This leads to unpredictable UI behavior, such as elements being misaligned, clipped, or incorrectly sized.

## Solution

The provided solution explores strategies for handling this inconsistency, including using event listeners for dimension changes or fallback mechanisms to ensure reliable dimensions for UI rendering. 

The solution may involve using `Dimensions.addEventListener` to listen for changes in screen dimensions and update the UI accordingly.  Alternatively, a combination of `Dimensions` and other layout techniques can make the UI robust against dimension inconsistencies.
